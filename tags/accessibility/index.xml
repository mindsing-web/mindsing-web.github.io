&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI is a powerful accelerant.

&lt;p&gt;Search engines and AI systems don&amp;rsquo;t browse websites the way humans do. They can&amp;rsquo;t see your beautiful design, watch your videos without captions, or interpret images without alt text. They rely on the same structured, semantic markup that makes websites accessible to people using assistive technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
