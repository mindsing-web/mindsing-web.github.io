Model Context Protocol (MCP) offers an elegant solution that&amp;rsquo;s particularly relevant for Drupal developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-model-context-protocol"&gt;What is Model Context Protocol?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol developed by Anthropic that standardizes how AI assistants connect to external data sources and tools. Think of it as a universal adapter that allows AI models to interact with your systems in a structured, secure, and contextually aware manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tip-Toeing into the Deep: AI-Powered Development Workflows</title><link>https://www.mindsing.com/blog/technology-innovation/ai-development-workflows/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mindsing.com/blog/technology-innovation/ai-development-workflows/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;At the 2024 Pacific Northwest Drupal Summit, MindSing sponsored a session exploring the practical integration of AI tools into modern development workflows. The session, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://pnwdrupalsummit.org/sessions/tiptoeing-deep-seek-prompt-repeat"&gt;Tip-Toeing into the Deep: Seek, Prompt, Repeat&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; demonstrated how developers can leverage AI assistance while maintaining code quality and deepening their expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-ai-development-revolution"&gt;The AI Development Revolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re in the midst of a fundamental shift in how developers work. Tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, and specialized coding assistants are no longer experimental novelties—they&amp;rsquo;re becoming integral parts of professional development workflows.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Getting Started with Automated Testing in Drupal</title><link>https://www.mindsing.com/blog/technology-innovation/automated-testing-drupal-getting-started/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mindsing.com/blog/technology-innovation/automated-testing-drupal-getting-started/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Automated testing is often viewed as a &amp;ldquo;nice to have&amp;rdquo; in Drupal development—something teams plan to implement &amp;ldquo;when there&amp;rsquo;s time.&amp;rdquo; But treating testing as optional is a costly mistake. The reality is that &lt;strong&gt;automated testing is fundamental to building maintainable Drupal applications&lt;/strong&gt;, reducing bugs, and enabling teams to refactor and upgrade with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide will walk you through the essentials of automated testing in Drupal, from basic concepts to practical implementation, helping you build a testing practice that actually fits into your development workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
