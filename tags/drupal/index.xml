Designers create pixel-perfect interfaces in Figma. Developers build functional components in Drupal. And somewhere in between, consistency evaporates like morning dew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem isn&amp;rsquo;t lack of talent—it&amp;rsquo;s lack of system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A design system is the bridge between Figma and your CMS, ensuring that what designers envision is what developers build, and what gets deployed stays consistent as your site grows. But most organizations approach design systems backwards: they try to document what exists rather than establishing a shared language from the start.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why Open Source Matters for Enterprise Web Development</title><link>/blog/technology-innovation/why-open-source-matters/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/technology-innovation/why-open-source-matters/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In the rapidly evolving landscape of web development, choosing the right foundation for your digital infrastructure is more critical than ever. At MindSing, we&amp;rsquo;re passionate advocates for open source technologies—particularly Drupal—and here&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-power-of-open-source"&gt;The Power of Open Source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source software represents more than just freely available code. It embodies a collaborative philosophy that drives innovation, ensures transparency, and provides long-term sustainability for your digital investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="transparency-and-security"&gt;Transparency and Security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you build on open source platforms, you&amp;rsquo;re not locked into a proprietary black box. Every line of code is inspectable, auditable, and verifiable. This transparency is crucial for enterprise organizations and higher education institutions that must maintain strict security and compliance standards.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>When to Rebuild vs. Redesign: How to Plan a Smart Digital Upgrade</title><link>/blog/strategy-growth/rebuild-vs-redesign-digital-upgrade/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/strategy-growth/rebuild-vs-redesign-digital-upgrade/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When your business is growing and your website is struggling to keep up, you face a critical decision: &lt;strong&gt;redesign&lt;/strong&gt; what you have or &lt;strong&gt;rebuild&lt;/strong&gt; from the ground up? This choice can mean the difference between a smart investment that accelerates growth and an expensive mistake that holds you back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For growth-stage businesses, this decision becomes even more crucial. You need a platform that can scale with your ambitions, support evolving marketing strategies, and integrate with your expanding tech stack—all without draining resources or disrupting operations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speedy Delivery: Win the GTM, SERP, and CWV Game with Layout Builder and Tailwind</title><link>/blog/performance-optimization/speedy-delivery-cwv-gtm/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/performance-optimization/speedy-delivery-cwv-gtm/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;At the 2024 Pacific Northwest Drupal Summit, MindSing sponsored a session exploring the critical relationship between Core Web Vitals, Google Tag Manager, and site performance.

&lt;h2 id="the-performance-paradox"&gt;The Performance Paradox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve optimized your Drupal site. Your code is clean, your images are compressed, your CSS is minimal. You run a Lighthouse audit and&amp;hellip; 85. Not bad, but not the perfect 100 you were aiming for. What&amp;rsquo;s holding you back? Often, it&amp;rsquo;s not your code—it&amp;rsquo;s Google Tag Manager.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The ROI of Open Source: Why Drupal &amp; WordPress Still Beat Proprietary CMS</title><link>/blog/strategy-growth/roi-open-source-cms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/strategy-growth/roi-open-source-cms/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When evaluating a content management system, the initial license fee is just the beginning of the story. The real question decision-makers should ask isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;What does it cost to buy?&amp;rdquo; but rather &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;What will it cost us to own, operate, and scale this platform over five years?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer might surprise you. Despite aggressive marketing from proprietary vendors positioning themselves as &amp;ldquo;enterprise-ready&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;all-in-one solutions,&amp;rdquo; the total cost of ownership (TCO) and long-term return on investment (ROI) consistently favor open source platforms—particularly Drupal and WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
