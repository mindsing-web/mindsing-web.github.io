But what if you could build a native, context-aware A/B testing system directly in Drupal—one that leverages your existing design system, automates variant creation, and uses AI to intelligently manage experiments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining &lt;a href="https://www.mindsing.com/blog/design-experience/figma-to-drupal-design-systems/"&gt;Figma&amp;rsquo;s design variants&lt;/a&gt;, Make&amp;rsquo;s automation capabilities, and &lt;a href="https://www.mindsing.com/blog/technology-innovation/model-context-protocol-drupal/"&gt;Model Context Protocol (MCP)&lt;/a&gt; for intelligent orchestration, we can create a powerful A/B testing workflow that feels native to Drupal while remaining accessible to designers and marketers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Model Context Protocol for Drupal</title><link>https://www.mindsing.com/blog/technology-innovation/model-context-protocol-drupal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mindsing.com/blog/technology-innovation/model-context-protocol-drupal/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.mindsing.com/blog/technology-innovation/ai-development-workflows/"&gt;AI tools become increasingly integrated into development workflows&lt;/a&gt;, a fundamental challenge has emerged: how do AI assistants effectively interact with complex, domain-specific systems like content management platforms? Model Context Protocol (MCP) offers an elegant solution that&amp;rsquo;s particularly relevant for Drupal developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-model-context-protocol"&gt;What is Model Context Protocol?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol developed by Anthropic that standardizes how AI assistants connect to external data sources and tools. Think of it as a universal adapter that allows AI models to interact with your systems in a structured, secure, and contextually aware manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
