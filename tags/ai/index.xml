&lt;p&gt;It cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI is a powerful accelerant. It is not a replacement for human judgment.&lt;/strong&gt; And in the domain of user experience design, that distinction is not philosophical—it has direct consequences for your users, your conversions, and your reputation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why Drupal Still Matters in the Age of AI Page Builders</title><link>https://www.mindsing.com/blog/technology-innovation/why-drupal-still-matters-ai-page-builders/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mindsing.com/blog/technology-innovation/why-drupal-still-matters-ai-page-builders/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The enterprise CMS landscape is experiencing a familiar disruption. AI-powered page builders promise what every previous wave of &amp;ldquo;revolutionary&amp;rdquo; tools has promised: faster development, lower costs, and democratized content creation. This time, however, the capability feels genuinely different. AI can generate layouts, write copy, optimize images, and assemble functional pages in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For digital leaders evaluating platform strategies, a reasonable question emerges: if AI can build pages this quickly, does a robust CMS like Drupal still matter?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Model Context Protocol for Drupal</title><link>https://www.mindsing.com/blog/technology-innovation/model-context-protocol-drupal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mindsing.com/blog/technology-innovation/model-context-protocol-drupal/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.mindsing.com/blog/technology-innovation/ai-development-workflows/"&gt;AI tools become increasingly integrated into development workflows&lt;/a&gt;, a fundamental challenge has emerged: how do AI assistants effectively interact with complex, domain-specific systems like content management platforms? Model Context Protocol (MCP) offers an elegant solution that&amp;rsquo;s particularly relevant for Drupal developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-model-context-protocol"&gt;What is Model Context Protocol?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol developed by Anthropic that standardizes how AI assistants connect to external data sources and tools. Think of it as a universal adapter that allows AI models to interact with your systems in a structured, secure, and contextually aware manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tip-Toeing into the Deep: AI-Powered Development Workflows</title><link>https://www.mindsing.com/blog/technology-innovation/ai-development-workflows/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mindsing.com/blog/technology-innovation/ai-development-workflows/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;At the 2024 Pacific Northwest Drupal Summit, MindSing sponsored a session exploring the practical integration of AI tools into modern development workflows. The session, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://pnwdrupalsummit.org/sessions/tiptoeing-deep-seek-prompt-repeat"&gt;Tip-Toeing into the Deep: Seek, Prompt, Repeat&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; demonstrated how developers can leverage AI assistance while maintaining code quality and deepening their expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-ai-development-revolution"&gt;The AI Development Revolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re in the midst of a fundamental shift in how developers work. Tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, and specialized coding assistants are no longer experimental novelties—they&amp;rsquo;re becoming integral parts of professional development workflows.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Accessibility First: SEO and AI Content</title><link>https://www.mindsing.com/blog/design-experience/accessibility-seo-ai/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mindsing.com/blog/design-experience/accessibility-seo-ai/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When organizations think about web accessibility, they often frame it as a compliance issue or an ethical obligation. While both are true, there&amp;rsquo;s a compelling business case that&amp;rsquo;s often overlooked: &lt;strong&gt;accessibility is the foundation of effective SEO and the key to making your content discoverable by generative AI systems&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-convergence-of-accessibility-seo-and-ai"&gt;The Convergence of Accessibility, SEO, and AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search engines and AI systems don&amp;rsquo;t browse websites the way humans do. They can&amp;rsquo;t see your beautiful design, watch your videos without captions, or interpret images without alt text. They rely on the same structured, semantic markup that makes websites accessible to people using assistive technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
