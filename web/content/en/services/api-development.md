**Modern enterprise web systems require seamless integration** with existing business systems, third-party services, and custom applications. We specialize in **custom API development** and **enterprise system integrations** that connect your web platform with the broader technology ecosystem.

## Custom API Development

We design and build scalable, secure APIs that serve as the backbone of modern enterprise applications, enabling seamless data flow and system integration.

### RESTful API Design
- Scalable backend services architecture
- Resource-based API design and documentation
- Authentication and authorization systems
- Rate limiting and security implementations

### GraphQL Solutions
- Efficient data fetching and query optimization
- Schema design for complex data relationships
- Real-time subscriptions and live updates
- Integration with existing REST services

### Microservices Architecture
- Distributed system design and implementation
- Service communication and message queuing
- Container orchestration and deployment
- Monitoring and logging solutions

## Enterprise System Integrations

Connect your web platform with existing business systems, creating a unified technology ecosystem that improves efficiency and data accuracy.

### CRM & Marketing Automation
- Salesforce, HubSpot, and Marketo integrations
- Lead capture and customer data synchronization
- Marketing campaign automation workflows
- Customer journey tracking and analytics

### Authentication & Identity Management
- Single Sign-On (SSO) implementations
- LDAP and Active Directory integration
- Multi-factor authentication systems
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

### Payment & E-commerce
- Secure payment gateway integrations
- Subscription and billing system connections
- Inventory management system APIs
- Order fulfillment and shipping integrations

## Higher Education Integrations

Academic institutions require specialized integrations with student information systems, learning platforms, and research databases.

### Student Information Systems
- Student data synchronization and management
- Grade reporting and transcript systems
- Registration and enrollment workflows

### Learning Management Systems
- Course content synchronization
- Single sign-on for educational platforms
- Grade passback and roster management

### Research & Academic Systems

## Technology Stack

Our integration solutions leverage modern, proven technologies that ensure reliability, performance, and long-term maintainability.

### Backend Development
- **PHP** (Laravel, Symfony)
- **Node.js** (Express, NestJS, Fastify)
- **Python** (Django, FastAPI)
- **Database Integration** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)

### API Technologies
- REST API design and implementation
- GraphQL schema development
- WebSocket real-time connections
- Message queuing (Redis, RabbitMQ)

### Integration Platforms
- Custom webhook implementations
- ETL data processing pipelines
- API gateway and proxy services

## Development Process

We follow a systematic approach to API development and integration, ensuring security, reliability, and comprehensive documentation.

### 1. Integration Assessment
- Current system analysis and documentation
- API capability evaluation
- Data flow mapping and requirements gathering
- Security and compliance considerations

### 2. API Design & Architecture
- RESTful resource design or GraphQL schema planning
- Authentication and authorization strategy
- Rate limiting and caching architecture
- Documentation and testing framework setup

### 3. Development & Testing
- Iterative API development and versioning
- Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, load)
- Security auditing and penetration testing
- Performance optimization and monitoring

### 4. Deployment & Monitoring
- Production deployment and configuration
- API monitoring and analytics setup
- Documentation and training delivery
- Ongoing maintenance and support planning
