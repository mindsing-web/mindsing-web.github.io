Whether it&amp;rsquo;s a blog post, a video, or an infographic, web users are always looking for something new to consume. That&amp;rsquo;s where original content production comes in. Original content can take many forms, but it always has one thing in common: it&amp;rsquo;s created specifically for the web. That means that it&amp;rsquo;s designed to be engaging and shareable, two essential qualities for any piece of online content.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Original Photography and Video</title><link>/services/multi-media/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/services/multi-media/</guid><description>&lt;p>Video production for the web has come a long way in recent years. High-quality cameras and editing software are now affordable and easy to use, making it possible for even novice users to produce professional-grade video content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The same is true of photography; although DSLRs are still the preferred choice of many professional photographers, point-and-shoot cameras are now capable of taking high-quality photos that can be easily edited and shared online.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Web Development</title><link>/services/web-development/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/services/web-development/</guid><description>&lt;p>We offer front-end and back-end web implementation services and focus on content management systems (CMS).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Drupal and WordPress are two of the most popular content management systems (CMS) on the market today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Drupal is a free and open source CMS that powers millions of websites and applications. WordPress is a self-hosted CMS that is used by millions of people around the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both Drupal and WordPress are great for creating websites, but they have different strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
