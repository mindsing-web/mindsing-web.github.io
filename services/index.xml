      <description>Original content is the bread and butter of the internet. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s a blog post, a video, or an infographic, web users are always looking for something new to consume. That&amp;rsquo;s where original content production comes in. Original content can take many forms, but it always has one thing in common: it&amp;rsquo;s created specifically for the web. That means that it&amp;rsquo;s designed to be engaging and shareable, two essential qualities for any piece of online content.</description>

      <description>Video production for the web has come a long way in recent years. High-quality cameras and editing software are now affordable and easy to use, making it possible for even novice users to produce professional-grade video content.
The same is true of photography; although DSLRs are still the preferred choice of many professional photographers, point-and-shoot cameras are now capable of taking high-quality photos that can be easily edited and shared online.</description>
